# tnetd-open
Trestor Network Validating Daemon

This is the open source version of tnetd.

This repo contains about 30,000 lines of code (25,000 SLOC), in about 190 source files.

This constitutes a large portion of code needed to build 'tnetd'.

4-5 files out of the 190 are currently not open sourced, because, the development is still in progress.

The rest of the code would be open-sourced, in time, when the distributed-voting is working efficiently and the system prevents all known DOS attack vectors.

As a result, the current version cannot be built to run a node. 

Even though the code passes all of our tests. We would like know about any blaring mistakes so that we can incorporate then in the current development repo.
